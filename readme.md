# The Secrets of Dyrt

These are the original Lua scripts I used to write the original version of Dyrt.
Please note that this repository only hosts a copy of these scripts, as the game was originally written long before I became a GitHub user, and thus my original project directory was totally not set up in a git-friendly way.
That being said I hope you realize it's pretty pointless to do pull-requests, as they will all be denied. Bug reports may still be done, but please note, that since this is an old project, also written in a ditched framework, it will take some time for them before I can fix any of them, and besides, on the longer term I'm planning a complete revision of the game, and once that project has begun the original version will get less and less priority.

The Phantasar universe is my property, so basically anything directly related to the story line is mine and may not be used for your own purposes without permission. Stripped from the references to the story line you may use most of the code under the terms of the zLib license, but please always check the license blocks of the code before using using it. ;)

Also note that the way the code has been organised and most particularly the ident layout is a way of coding I no longer use. I was a bit headstrong back then, but I've seen the light :P

All-in-all, this repository serves most of all for preservation purposes. Enjoy!

The game itself can be downloaded from http://tricky.gamejolt.io/Dyrt

One note, this repository only contains the Lua scripts. You need the LAURA  engine to actually run any of them, and JCR5 to create a package for LAURA. Both LAURA and JCR5 are discontinued projects, though and will only be kept up-to-date in order to make bugfixing for Dyrt or other gmaes in my older framework possible. If you want to keep LAURA alive, please lemme know and I can tell you all about it ;)

Have fun ;)
